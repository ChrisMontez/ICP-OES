# ICP-OES

## :thought_balloon: Background 
Scientists from  University of KwaZulu-Natal conducted an array of ICP-OES analysis experiments to assess contamination in the Flag Boshielo Dam. They found that when a body of water is introduced to metal contamination it is retained by the various organisms, and the bottom sediment rather than remaining suspended in the water. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was performed on the metal(loid) concentrations within the gill, liver, and muscle of two fish species during two different seasons. Cluster analysis show little difference between metal concentration within the fish between winter and summer[fig 1.] while showing statistically notable difference between species.

## :bar_chart: Data Analysis 
A supplementary XLS file with data pertaining to the fish specimens' morphometry and the concentrations of metal(loid)s. The recorded results in the varying organs were provided by The National Center for Biotechnology Information and the scientists from University of KwaZulu-Natal. This is an exploratory analysis of that data. The code behind these visualizations can be found in the Jupyter notebook titled "Data Visualization.ipynb".
